# Designed a Data Warehouse based on Star Schema for a Retail Business
Hi there! Welcome to this repository!<br/>

My team and I designed a data warehouse based on star-schema for a retail database called Northwind.
The Northwind database is a sample database that was originally created by Microsoft and used as the basis for their tutorials in a variety of
database products for decades. The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders”, which
imports and exports specialty foods from around the world.

Several tables were designed as Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension tables as required by our tutor. 
In this repository, you will find SQL code for:
<ul>
  <li>Creation of the OLTP System</li>
  <li>Creation of the Data Warehouse</li>
  <li>Both the initial and subsequent loading of the Data Warehouse</li>
  <li>Business Intelligence Reports</li>  
</ul>

If you are interested in the documentation, you may refer to the pdf report that was uploaded into this repository. You will find the star schema in it. The outputs of the SQL queries and visualisations from Microsoft Excel can be found in there as well.
